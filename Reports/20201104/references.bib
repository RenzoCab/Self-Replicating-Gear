    abstract = { The concept of an artificial corporeal machine that can reproduce has attracted the attention of researchers from various fields over the past century. Some have approached the topic with a desire to understand biological life and develop artificial versions; others have examined it as a potentially practical way to use material resources from the moon and Mars to bootstrap the exploration and colonization of the solar system. This review considers both bodies of literature, with an emphasis on the underlying principles required to make self-replicating robotic systems from raw materials a reality. We then illustrate these principles with machines from our laboratory and others and discuss how advances in new manufacturing processes such as 3-D printing can have a synergistic effect in advancing the development of such systems. }

    abstract = { Modern robots are increasingly capable of performing “basic” activities such as localization, navigation, and motion planning. However, for a robot to be considered intelligent, we would like it to be able to automatically combine these capabilities in order to achieve a high-level goal. The field of automated planning (sometimes called AI planning) deals with automatically synthesizing plans that combine basic actions to achieve a high-level goal. In this article, we focus on the intersection of automated planning and robotics and discuss some of the challenges and tools available to employ automated planning in controlling robots. We review different types of planning formalisms and discuss their advantages and limitations, especially in the context of planning robot actions. We conclude with a brief guide aimed at helping roboticists choose the right planning model to endow a robot with planning capabilities. }

    abstract = { Here, we review the role of control theory in modeling neural control systems through a top-down analysis approach. Specifically, we examine the role of the brain and central nervous system as the controller in the organism, connected to but isolated from the rest of the animal through insulated interfaces. Though biological and engineering control systems operate on similar principles, they differ in several critical features, which makes drawing inspiration from biology for engineering controllers challenging but worthwhile. We also outline a procedure that the control theorist can use to draw inspiration from the biological controller: starting from the intact, behaving animal; designing experiments to deconstruct and model hierarchies of feedback; modifying feedback topologies; perturbing inputs and plant dynamics; using the resultant outputs to perform system identification; and tuning and validating the resultant control-theoretic model using specially engineered robophysical models. }

It gives special attention to new and unexplored research directions and relations with other mathematical frameworks. Emergent control paradigms and open problems are indicated, including the relation with thermodynamics and the question of uniting the energy-processing view of control, as emphasized by port-Hamiltonian systems theory, with a complementary information-processing viewpoint. }
